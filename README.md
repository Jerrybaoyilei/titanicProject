My attempt on the titanic survival data analysis, using Machine Learning to predict the survival of passengers.

Data is downloaded from Kaggle. 

1. Ploted survival against different features, including embarked location, number of parent/children, number of siblings/spouses, etc. 
2. Dealt with null values
  2.1 Filled cabin null values with a string 
  2.2 Presumed the missing embarked location is Soutampton because most passengered embarked from there
  2.3 Used average ticket fare to full in missing fare values
3.
